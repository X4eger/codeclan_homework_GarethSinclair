## 2.1 Part 1

### Question 1 
Take the data in the dataset qb_revenue_breakdown and make a stacked abr chart showing the sources of revenue across the two years in the dataset

```{r}

qb_revenue_breakdown %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Product, y = Revenue, fill = Year)) +
  geom_col()

```

### Question 2
Make a line chart showing monthly sales of the "flagship product" - the 'KwikBit Unit 1' - over the last year. This data is inside qb_monthly_sales, but you will need to use filter or subset

```{r}

qb_monthly_sales %>% 
  filter(Cashflow == "Kwikbit Unit 1 Sales") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Date, y = Amount))+
  geom_line()

```

### Question 3
Make a line chart showing monthly revenue and costs over the last year. This data is also in qb_monthly_sales

```{r}

qb_monthly_sales %>% 
  filter(Cashflow != "Kwikbit Unit 1 Sales") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Date, y = Amount, group = Cashflow, colour = Cashflow)) +
  geom_line()
  
```

### Question 4
Show annual sales of personal fitness trackers over the last 5 years broken down by company as a ribbon plot(use geom_area). This data is in qb_competitors

```{r}

qb_competitors %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = Revenue, fill = Company)) +
  geom_area()


```

### Question 5
Now show the sales from the four competitors as a line graph. Include an extra layer that shows the data points used to make the lines. 

```{r}

qb_competitors %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = Revenue, group = Company, colour = Company)) +
  geom_line()+
  geom_point()
```

### Question 6
Now the company wants to compare the number of steps that their device counts vs their competitors. Make a line graph of the number of steps throughout time, and use faceting to compare between companies and people. The data for this is in qb_device_data. 

```{r}

qb_device_data %>%
  mutate(time = (hours * 60) + mins) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = time, y = counts, group = id, colour = device))+
  geom_line()+
  facet_wrap(~device)
  

```
