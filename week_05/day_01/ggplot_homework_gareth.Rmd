## 2.1 Part 1

### Question 1 
Take the data in the dataset qb_revenue_breakdown and make a stacked abr chart showing the sources of revenue across the two years in the dataset

```{r}

qb_revenue_breakdown %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Product, y = Revenue, fill = Year)) +
  geom_col()

```

### Question 2
Make a line chart showing monthly sales of the "flagship product" - the 'KwikBit Unit 1' - over the last year. This data is inside qb_monthly_sales, but you will need to use filter or subset

```{r}

qb_monthly_sales %>% 
  filter(Cashflow == "Kwikbit Unit 1 Sales") %>% 
  arrange(Date) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Date, y = Amount))+
  geom_line()
```
